# Logistic-Regression-Model-and-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Adidas-Dataset
Nowadays, the sportswear industry is highly competitive, with multiple global and local brands vying for market share. Like any other brand, Adidas faces challenges in maintaining its market position and driving revenue growth in the sportswear industry. The rise of new competitors and the establishment of new businesses can significantly impact a brand's sales and market share. Increasing competition from global and local brands could be one of the key factors contributing to Adidas' declining market position. Long-standing competitors like Nike and Puma have a strong market presence and customer loyalty. Adidas must stay ahead of the curve and offer unique and compelling offers to attract customers as these brands constantly innovate and introduce new products. 

Furthermore, the entry of new companies into the sportswear industry can disrupt market dynamics and pose additional challenges to established brands such as Adidas. These new entrants frequently bring new ideas, technologies, and marketing strategies that can attract customers while potentially eroding market share from established brands. To maintain revenue growth and address these challenges, Adidas must focus on several strategies, including product innovation, marketing and digital presence, a consumer-centric approach, and global expansion. Therefore, it is essential to create such a model which can predict the total sales group of each Adidas store and outlet in the US, either low, medium, or high, so that a more precise and efficient business strategy can be taken immediately without waste of financial and resources to solve the particular issue faced by “low sales” store. The objectives of this analysis are listed as follows: Objectives: 
1. To build a logistic regression model for predicting the total sales groups.
2. To conduct the sentiment analysis on the Twitter data of Adidas.
